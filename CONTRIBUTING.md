# Contributing to Cross API Engine

This guide ensures contributions are **consistent, readable, and maintainable**.

---

## Contribution workflow
We strictly use **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests** (PRs).
No direct commits to `main` are allowed.

### Create / Find an Issue
Before contributing, make sure there is an **open issue** for your task.
If not, **create one** using the provided templates:

- **Bug Report**
- **Feature Request**

### Branching & PR Naming
Each contribution must be developed in a dedicated branch.
Branches and Pull Requests must follow this naming convention:
```
<Type>/<Scope>/<Short-Description>
```
- **Type** → `Feature` | `Fix` | `Refactor` | `Docs` | `Test` | `CI`
- **Scope** → `Core` | `Audio` | `Input` | `Network` | `Renderer` | `Window`
- **Short-Description** → A concise summary of the change (use hyphens for spaces).

This ensures consistency across branches and PRs, making it easy to identify the purpose of each contribution at a glance.
